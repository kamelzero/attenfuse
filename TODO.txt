Files that look good (well-implemented):
1. cleanup_carla_actors.py - Complete and functional
2. carla_fusion_env.py - Well-structured gym environment with proper observation/action spaces
3. fusion_attention_module.py - Complete attention fusion implementation
4. log_sensors.py - Good sensor logging implementation

Files that need work:
1. train_ppo_policy.py - Too basic, needs:
Better hyperparameters
Logging and checkpoints
Evaluation during training
2. ppo_attention_training.py - Needs:
Learning rate scheduling
Better network architecture
Proper reward shaping
3. run_trained_policy.py and run_trained_policy_with_video.py - Nearly identical files that should be merged
4. test_carla_env_random.py - Good for testing but could use:
More comprehensive tests
Better error handling
Performance metrics

Would you like me to:
    - Start improving the training infrastructure?
    - Merge the duplicate policy running scripts?
    - Focus on a specific component?
