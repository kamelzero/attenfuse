1.
When I ssh'd into the instance, I had to use sudo on git.
To fix that, from the attenfuse directory, I had to run: sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) .
I shouldn't have to do that manualy; need to look into whether scripts need to be modified.

2.
when I try install opencv and carla.
I shouldn't need to do this manually.

I need to run:
 pip install --upgrade pip
 pip install -r requirements.txt
